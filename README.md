# Advanced TypeScript Course

This repository contains materials for an advanced course on TypeScript, designed to deepen understanding and proficiency in TypeScript for both front-end and back-end development. The course is structured into several modules, each targeting specific aspects of TypeScript.

## Course Modules

### Module 2: Explore Advanced Types of TypeScript

- **2-1: Type Assertion / Type Narrowing**

  - Learn how to use type assertion to narrow down the type of variables and improve type checking.

- **2-2: Interface vs Type**

  - Understand the differences and use-cases for Interfaces and Types in TypeScript.

- **2-3: Introduction to Generics**

  - An overview of generics, why they are useful, and how to use them to create flexible and reusable code.

- **2-4: Generic with Interface**

  - Combining generics with interfaces to enforce type checking while maintaining flexibility.

- **2-5: Function with Generics**

  - How to define functions that can operate on multiple data types using generics.

- **2-6: Constraints in TypeScript**

  - Learn to apply constraints to generics to restrict what types can be used with them.

- **2-7: Constraint Using Key of**

  - Techniques for using the `keyof` operator with constraints to access the properties of an object more safely.
